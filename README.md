# mazes
Tested the efficiency (% of cells explored) of various search algorithms on mazes I created. You can also use this project to create and solve binary mazes. 

I created a recursive division function to design the mazes. Used Pillow to print out a small png file img (zoom in to see the image better) so that I can visualize the maze better. Used Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and a "Smart" algorithm of my own design to solve the mazes.
