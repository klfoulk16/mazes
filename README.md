# mazes
Tested the efficiency (% of cells explored) of various search algorithms for solving mazes. This project also creates and solves binary mazes. 

1) Designed a recursive division function to create the mazes. 
2) Used Pillow to print out a small png file img (zoom in to see the image better) so that I can visualize the maze better. 
3) Used Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and a "Smart" algorithm of my own design to solve the mazes.
4) Tested the algorithms against each other on a series of 500 mazes to see which is the most efficient in terms of percent of the maze explored
